# Driver distraction driving simulator tests

The test suite contains 12 tests, one in each folder.

The goal of the participant is, while driving a vehicle, to find the letter combination indicated by the corresponding test and click it. The correct letter combination is hidden among similar looking letter combinations.

The numbers in the folder names indicate the number of clickable elements in each test. The letter "h" in the folder name indicates that the letter combination is not present among the clickable objects.

You may host the test on, e.g., pavlovia.org if you want to run the tests over the internet. Otherwise, the tests may be run locally. To avoid any unwarranted distractions, you may want to use a borderless web browser, e.g., FullScreenBrowser on mobile devices.
